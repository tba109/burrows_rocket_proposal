This is the FX2LP USB firmware for the Burrows PSU/UIowa rocket proposal. 

The FX2LP I2C EEPROM is set to renumerate as VID 04B4, PID 1010.

It uses the default USB device for sending data packets (512B bulk packets on EP2OUT). 

The GPIF engine sits around waiting for RDY0, and puts new data on the bus when it gets it.
